      This issue should be for problems accessing PyPI itself, including:
      * pypi.org
      * test.pypi.org
      * files.pythonhosted.org
  
      This issue **should NOT** be for any non-PyPI properties (like
      python.org, docs.python.org, etc.)

      Any details about your specific platform:
      * If the problem is in the browser, what browser, version, and OS?
      * If the problem is with a command-line tool, what version of that tool?
      * If the problem is with connecting to PyPI, include some details about
        your network, including SSL/TLS implementation in use, internet service
        provider, and if there are any firewalls or proxies in use.
